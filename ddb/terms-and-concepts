                               TERMS AND CONCEPTS
                               ------------------

1. USER

    The USER represents an entity that can provide VOTES on ITEMS.  They have a
    name, which can change, and a CONNECTION While they are connected to a
    SESSION.  USERS don't exist outside of the context of a SESSION.

    Within a SESSION, no two USERS can share the same name, regardless of case.
    A user may exist in a SESSION beyond the time where they coincided with an
    active socket, if they have cast any VOTES.

2. ITEM

    The ITEMS are the topics that are discussed during a SESSION.  Each item
    comprises a name and an number of VOTES issued by USERS.

3. VOTE

    A VOTE is issued by a USER and regards an ITEM.  A VOTE contains both
    coordinates, along the horizontal and vertical axes, of the estimation
    given by a USER for their perceived location of the corresponding ITEM on
    the scales defined by the SESSION configuration.

4. SESSION

    A SESSION is the core concept around which everything is built.  USERS come
    together into a SESSION and define its configuration: the ITEMS that will
    be discussed, as well as the names and scales of the two axes along which
    voting is permitted.

5. CONNECTION

    A CONNECTION is what makes a USER "online".  A USER issues VOTES through a
    CONNECTION, and may change their name while remaining identifiable through
    that same CONNECTION.  A CONNECTION corresponds to a Web socket session
    that a client browser establishes with the API Gateway endpoint.
